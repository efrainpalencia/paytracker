    Automates the download of pay statements from the ADP web portal using pyautogui.

    Assumes:
    - The user has already logged into ADP and navigated to the Pay Statements page.
    - The user has manually clicked "Show More" to expose all statement items.
    - The first pay statement is aligned at a known screen position.

    This script:
    - Clicks each pay statement one by one
    - Clicks the 'Download PDF' button
    - Presses ESC to close the preview
    - Scrolls just enough to bring the next item into position
